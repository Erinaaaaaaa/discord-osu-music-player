# discord-osu-music-player (0% done)
The goal of this project is to make a music player bot that could play one's local osu! song library.

### What we're planning to make it able to:
 - play music from your osu! music library (_obviously_)
 - play the different mp3 files from mapsets with multiple songs (just like from the Jump Training mapsets)
 - create playlists
 
### What it will probably won't do:
 - Read your osu! collections and map library from osu! database files. They seem to be using a custom database format that changes often.
 - Manage your maps.
 
## Libraries this bot will use:
 - smoogipooo's [osu-BMAPI](https://github.com/smoogipooo/osu-BMAPI)
 - [Discord.NET](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net)
